# Find a good pair to do pairs trading

### Ideas behind:

1) Random walk?

When the market is efficient, assets prices are random walk. Then it's impossible to do forecasting, because random walk is unpredictable. Like if we know the asset is more mean-reverting, it's easier to predict the move (e.g. according to its range and half-life period). There's a way to test if the price(t) has any correlation to it's history price: Augmented Dickey_Fuller test. 


2) Pairs trading?

Even if two single assets are both in random walk, it's still possible that their linear combination is in a fixed spread and can be traded as mean reversion. Then we can simply sell the more expensive one and buy the cheaper one. Here we usually use Cointegration and ADF to test if they are good pairs. 

### Example: MSFT & AAPL
From the plot we can see they usually move together:


```python
from quantopian.research.experimental import continuous_future, history
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import coint, adfuller
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import statsmodels.tsa.stattools as ts 

pairs = symbols(['MSFT','AAPL'])
msft = get_pricing('MSFT',fields = 'price',start_date = '2016-01-01',end_date = '2017-01-01')
aapl = get_pricing('AAPL',fields = 'price',start_date = '2016-01-01',end_date = '2017-01-01')
msft.multiply(1.8).plot()
aapl.plot()
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.legend(['MSFT*1.8', 'AAPL'])
```

### Cointegration:

There's an interesting description about cointegration：A drunk guy is walking the dog. When they turn into a busy road, he let his dog lead him. We can see both the moves of him and his dog are random, but the distance between them is in a fixed range. This spread is stationary and we say their moves are cointegrated. If we can find a pair in stocks market or futures or anything we can trade, and their relation just like this man and his dog, then it's easy to make money.

From the low p-value, we can reject the null hypothesis(zero cointegration) and conclude that MSFT&AAPL is a stationary series and hence a cointegrated pair


```python
print 'Cointegtration P-Value:', ts.coint(msft,aapl)[1]
```

    Cointegtration P-Value: 0.0867209897551


### Correlation:

High correlation means when A goes up, B goes up. But their spread can go insanely higher high, then it could be a bad pair. However, if A and B are cointegrated, it's very likely to find a linear combination between them to build a pair with fixed spread.

I used to find pairs according to the correlation table, then adjust hedge ratio dynamically to make the spread more stable. Not sure if it's better than just scanned by cointegration (will look at it later...)


```python
print 'MSFT&AAPL Correlation:',np.corrcoef(msft,aapl)[1][0]
```

    MSFT&AAPL Correlation: 0.892900647079


### Augmented Dickey_Fuller test (ADF)

we can describe the price change in this linear model:

∆y(t) = 𝜆y(t-1)+𝜇+𝛽t+𝛼1∆y(t-1)+...+𝛼k∆y(t-k)+𝜀t

Let's do the Hypothetical test in which H0: 𝜆 = 0   

If we can reject 𝜆=0, it means ∆y(t) somehow depends on y(t-1), so that the price is not random walk.

After scanned by correlation or cointegration, we now have a spread: AAPL-beta*MSFT. We need to know if it's stationary by adfuller()

You should find the ADF t-statistic is smaller than Critical value at 90% level, so we can reject the hypothesis that 𝜆 is zero. In other words, the spread AAPL-1.2*MSFT is stationary


```python
beta = 1.2
print 'ADF t-statistic: ', adfuller(aapl-beta*msft)[0]
print 'Critical value at 90% level', adfuller(aapl-beta*msft)[4]['10%']
```

    ADF t-statistic:  -2.65495151936
    Critical value at 90% level -2.572968544


We now change beta into some other value, let's try 1.7:

Then you should find the hedge ratio beta matters. It can affect the mean reversion of the spread


```python
beta = 1.7
print 'p-value for stationarity: ', adfuller(aapl-beta*msft)[0]
print '90% Critical value', adfuller(aapl-beta*msft)[4]['10%']
```

    p-value for stationarity:  -2.55888807634
    90% Critical value -2.57307007601


Now I want to try testing the Corn and Wheat, since they are economically-linked. People usually use one to hedge the another. Let's see what's the result.

It's a good example about the correlation and cointegration: higher correlation doesn't means they are good cointegrated pairs.


```python
CN_future = continuous_future('CN')
WC_future = continuous_future('WC')
corn = history(sm_future, fields='price', frequency='daily',start='2016-01-01', end='2017-01-01')
wheat = history(bo_future, fields='price',frequency='daily', start='2016-01-01', end='2017-01-01')

corn.plot()
wheat.plot()
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.legend(['corn', 'wheat'])

print 'Correlation:', np.corrcoef(corn, wheat)[1][0]
print 'Cointegtration P-Value:',ts.coint(corn,wheat)[1]
print 'p-value for stationarity: ', adfuller(corn-wheat)[0]
print '90% Critical value', adfuller(corn-wheat)[4]['10%']
```

    Correlation: 0.856721428222
    Cointegtration P-Value: 0.39350760277
    p-value for stationarity:  -0.883433237302
    90% Critical value -2.57304438247
